        <div class="player-dob">Born: February 5, 1990</div>
        <div class="player-info">
            <p style=" text-align: start;">Bhuvneshwar Kumar Singh (born 5 February 1990) is an Indian international cricketer who played for the Indian cricket team from 2012 to 2022. He currently plays for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League and Uttar Pradesh in domestic cricket. A right-arm medium bowler, he is known by the nickname "Swing King" for his ability to swing the ball both ways efficiently, with his inswingers more effective than outswingers.[3][4] Initially starting his career as an opening swing bowler, Kumar upgraded his bowling armoury with reverse swing, slower balls and yorkers to become a death over specialist. With India, Kumar won the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. He became the first bowler to win a Purple Cap of IPL in two consecutive seasons.

            He made his international debut in December 2012 against Pakistan, taking three wickets in a Twenty20 International, including one in his first over. He went on to make his One Day International (ODI) debut in the series which followed, where he took a wicket on his first ball.[5][6] He is the first Indian bowler to take a five-wicket haul in Test cricket, ODIs and T20Is.[7] He is the only bowler whose first wicket in all three formats of the game was bowled. During the 2022 Asia Cup, he was the highest wicket taker with 11 wickets.
            
            Kumar plays for Uttar Pradesh in domestic cricket;[6] he has also played for Central Zone in the Duleep Trophy[6][10] and made his first-class debut at the age of 17 against Bengal.[6][11] In the 2008/09 Ranji Trophy final, he became the first bowler to dismiss Sachin Tendulkar for a duck in first-class cricket.
        
            Following his performances in the 2008/09 Ranji season, he was given an Indian Premier League (IPL) contract by Royal Challengers Bangalore.[13] In 2011, he was signed by Pune Warriors India, but after the team was dissolved in 2013, he was bought by Sunrisers Hyderabad for ₹4.25 crores during the 2014 IPL Auction.[14][15]

            In 2016, he played in Sunrisers' team which won the 2016 Indian Premier League, taking 23 wickets and winning the Purple Cap as the bowler who took most wickets during the season.[16][17] In 2018, he was named the team's vice-captain.
        
            In the 2022 Indian Premier League mega-auction, Kumar was bought by the Sunrisers Hyderabad for ₹4.20 crores.[19] He was later released by Sunrisers Hyderabad after the 2024 Indian Premier League. In the auctions held in November 2024, Kumar was bought by Royal Challengers Bangalore for ₹10.75 crores.</p>
