        <div class="player-info">
            <p style=" text-align: start;">Mohammed Shami[a] (Hindi: [ʃʌmiː]; born 3 September 1990) is an Indian international cricketer who plays as a right-arm fast-bowler, for the India national cricket team and for the Bengal in domestic cricket[3] and for the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League. He also plays for Mohun Bagan in domestic competitions of West Bengal. One of the most consistent wicket takers in contemporary world cricket, Shami bowls the ball off the seam and uses swing, including reverse swing, to move the ball both directions. He has been reputed to have an edge in the death (slog) overs of a limited-overs innings and, in all formats, has been described as being at times "unplayable". Shami finished as India's leading wicket taker in the ICC World Cup 2023, besides being the fastest bowler to take 50 wickets in the 48 years history of Cricket World Cup spanning 13 editions. He is recipient of 2023 Arjuna Award for Cricket. Having taken 7 wickets for 57 runs against New Zealand in the 2023 Cricket World Cup semi final, he holds the record for the best figures for an Indian Bowler in ODIs, and is currently, the only Indian bowler to have taken 7 wickets in an ODI innings.

            Shami took four wickets on his senior debut for Bengal in a Twenty20 match in October 2010.[13] The following month, he made his first-class cricket debut against Assam at Eden Gardens, taking three wickets in a high scoring match.[14][15]

            In February 2012 his bowling helped East Zone win their first Duleep Trophy title; he took eight wickets in the match and was described as "outstanding, consistently getting bounce and zip from just short of a good length".[16] He had only played in the match following an injury to Abu Nechim, but it proved to be a significant breakthrough in Shami's career;[17] he had been described as "little-known" before the match,[18] but by April was being touted as a player to watch in the upcoming Indian Premier League season.

            He was selected to tour the West Indies with the India A side and "impressed" with his bowling on pitches which were considered to be generally unhelpful to fast bowlers.[19] Shami was considered to have been the "surprise package" of the tour for India A, and impressed the team's coach Lalchand Rajput with his strength and consistency whilst bowling, as well as with his batting;[20] batting tenth in the first unofficial Test match, he scored 27 runs in a partnership of 73 with Cheteshwar Pujara which won the match for India A.[21] Later in the year he was one of only two fast bowlers retained for the India A tour of New Zealand,[22] although he only played in two of the six matches on the tour.
