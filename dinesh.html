        <div class="player-name">Dinesh Karthik</div>
        <div class="player-dob">Born: June 1, 1985</div>
        <div class="player-info">
            <p style=" text-align: start;">Krishnakumar Dinesh Karthik (born 1 June 1985) is an Indian professional    cricketer, coach, and commentator. Karthik played for the India national cricket team and also captained Tamil Nadu in domestic cricket. He is currently the batting coach for Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL.

            Karthik made his debut for the Indian cricket team in 2004. He was the 4th Indian batsman to play 300 T20 matches.[1] Karthik was a member of the team that won both the inaugural 2007 T20 World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. Karthik is also the first Indian ever to win a Player of The Match award in a T20 International, having done so in 2006. Known for his six hitting ability, aggressive batting style, longevity and ability to finish games strong, Karthik was viewed as a crucial asset in the IPL and the India national cricket team for almost two decades.
                
            Karthik made his maiden Test century against Bangladesh and was India's leading scorer in their 2007 Test tour of England,[2] helping India win their first series in England in 21 years. After a drop in form in September 2007, Karthik was dropped from the Test team and only made sporadic international appearances through 2022
                
            Between 2018 and 2020, Karthik was the captain of IPL team Kolkata Knight Riders. He also occasionally worked as a commentator for British channel Sky Sports, most notably during India's 2021 tour of England.
        
            Karthik made his debut in late 2002 against Baroda as a wicket-keeper.[14] He batted in five matches of the round-robin, scoring 179 runs at an average of 35.80 with a top score of 88 not out against Uttar Pradesh in his second match.[6][5][15] Karthik's form tapered off after this match, and he failed to pass 20 again during the season.[6] He took 11 catches[16] but due to repeated wicket-keeping errors, he was dropped from the season's final matches.[17]

            Karthik was overlooked in the selection for the zonal Duleep Trophy, and played in the under-19s for South Zone. He was more productive in his second zonal season, scoring 180 runs at 60.00 with three half-centuries.[6] He was selected for the national under-19 team, and played in three youth One Day Internationals (ODIs) against Nepal.[6]

            Karthik attended a wicket-keeping camp in the off-season under, guided by former Indian keeper and chairman of selectors Kiran More, which he credited with improving his technique. After playing in the Chennai League, he returned to the under-22 team at the start of the season before his selection for India Emerging Players to play their youthful counterparts from Sri Lanka and Pakistan in late September.</p>
