        <div class="player-dob">Born: November 5, 1988</div>
        <div class="player-info">
            <p style=" text-align: start;">Virat Kohli (Hindi pronunciation: [ʋɪˈɾɑːʈ ˈkoːɦli] ⓘ; born 5 November 1988) is an Indian international cricketer who plays
                 Test and ODI cricket for the national team and is a former captain in all formats. He is a right-handed batsman and an
                  occasional right arm medium pace bowler. Kohli holds the highest IPL run-scorer record, ranks third in T20I,
                   third in ODI, and stands the fourth-highest in international cricket.[4] Regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time,
                    he holds the record for most centuries in ODI and is second on the list of most international centuries in international cricket.[5]

            Kohli was a member of the Indian team that won the 2008 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 Champions Trophy and
             2024 T20 World Cup and also captained India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018, and 2019.[6] He represents 
             Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Indian Premier League and Delhi in domestic cricket.
            
            In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ODI batsmen ICC rankings. In 2015, he also achieved the same for T20I rankings.[7] In 2018, 
            he was ranked the top Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats. He is the first
             player to score 20,000 runs in a decade. In 2020, the ICC named him the male cricketer of the decade.[8]
            
            Kohli has garnered 10 ICC Awards making him the most awarded player in International Cricket history. He won the ICC ODI Player of the 
            Year award four times in 2012, 2017, 2018, and 2023. He also won the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy, given to the ICC Cricketer of the Year,
             on two occasions, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. In 2018, he became the first player to win both ICC ODI and Test Player of the Year 
             awards in the same year. Also, he was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World for three consecutive years, from 2016 to 2018.
              Kohli has the most Player of the Series awards and second most Player of the Match awards to his name in all three formats combined.
               He was honoured with the Arjuna Award in 2013, the Padma Shri in 2017, and India's highest sporting honour, the Khel Ratna Award, in 2018.
                In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world.
            
            After winning the 2024 T20 World Cup and the Player of the Match in the Final, Kohli announced his retirement from T20Is.[9]
            
            Early life
            Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer,
             and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[10] Kohli's formative
              years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[11] According to his family, Kohli 
              exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request his father bowl to him.[12]
            
            In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli arranged for his son to meet Rajkumar Sharma.
            [13] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that
             his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket.[14] Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure
              a place in the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs,
               which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.[15] He received 
               training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[16] In pursuit of
                furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[14]
