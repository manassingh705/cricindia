        <div class="player-dob">Born: October 4, 1997</div>
        <div class="player-info">
            <p style=" text-align: start;">Rishabh Rajendra Pant (Hindi: [ɾɪˈʂʌbʰ ɾaː'dʒeːd̪ɾə pʌnt̪]; born 4 October 1997) is an Indian international cricketer who plays for the Indian cricket team as a wicket-keeper batter. He plays for Lucknow Super Giants in the Indian Premier League. Having played all formats for India, he is best known for his consistency to score runs in Test cricket. Pant plays for Delhi in domestic cricket.

                Pant became the most expensive player of Indian Premier League in the history as he was bought for ₹27.00 crore (£2.6 million) by Lucknow Super Giants in Indian Premier League auction 2025. He was a member of the Indian team that won the 2024 T20 World Cup. He was the vice-captain of the India U-19 team that was runner-up at the 2016 Under-19 Cricket World Cup.[3]
                
                He made his Twenty20 International (T20I) debut for India in January 2017, his Test debut in August 2018, and his One Day International (ODI) debut in October 2018. In January 2019, Pant was named the ICC Men's Emerging Cricketer of the Year at the 2018 ICC Awards.[4] In February 2021, Pant was named the Men's Player of the Month in the first edition of the ICC Player of the Month Awards.[5]
                
                In June 2022, Pant was named as the Indian captain for the T20I series against South Africa, after the designated captain KL Rahul was ruled out of the series due to an injury.[6] In the 2025 IPL auction, Pant was bought by the Lucknow Super Giants for a record-breaking 27 crores.
            
                Pant made his first-class debut on 22 October 2015 in the 2015–16 Ranji Trophy[12] and his List A debut the next month in the 2015–16 Vijay Hazare Trophy.[13]

                In the 2016–17 Ranji Trophy, while playing a match against Maharashtra, Pant scored 308 runs in an innings, becoming the third-youngest Indian to score a triple century in first-class cricket.[14][15]

                On 8 November 2016, Pant scored the fastest century in the Ranji Trophy, from just 48 balls,[16] in Delhi's match against Jharkhand.[17]

                In February 2017, Pant was named Delhi's captain for the 2016–17 Vijay Hazare Trophy. He took over from Gautam Gambhir, who led Delhi to the final of the previous season. Delhi coach Bhaskar Pillai said it was a "consensus decision" to prepare Pant for the future.[18]

                On 14 January 2018, in the 2017–18 Zonal T20 League match between Himachal Pradesh and Delhi, Pant scored the second-fastest century in a Twenty20 match, making 100 from 32 balls.</p>
